### Library Management System (LMS) | C, Linked List, LCS Algorithm

**July 2024**

**Project Description:**
- Developed a Library Management System (LMS) using C with Linked Lists to manage book records efficiently.
- Implemented key functionalities including adding, updating, and deleting book records, as well as searching for books using various algorithms.

**Key Algorithm: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**
- Utilized the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm to enhance search capabilities based on author and title criteria.
- The LCS algorithm compares characters between two strings to find the longest sequence that is common to both. This is particularly useful for fuzzy matching in search queries.
- The algorithm constructs a dynamic programming table to efficiently compute the LCS, providing an optimized search mechanism.
- Time Complexity: O(m * n), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two input strings.

**Automated Searching Function:**
- Developed an automated search function that leverages the LCS algorithm to find books with similar titles or authors based on user input.
- The function dynamically adjusts the search results to display books with the closest matches, improving the accuracy and relevance of search results.

**Features:**
- **Book Management:** Add, update, and delete book records using Linked Lists.
- **Search Optimization:** Integrate the LCS algorithm for improved search accuracy based on titles and authors.
- **Automated Search:** Automate search processes to handle user queries effectively, providing relevant results based on similarity.

**Objective:**
- Enhance the efficiency of search operations within the LMS by utilizing the LCS algorithm to manage and retrieve book records based on string similarity. This approach aims to improve user experience by offering accurate and relevant search results.

**Results:**
- Implemented an effective search mechanism that supports fuzzy matching, optimizing data retrieval and enhancing the overall usability of the LMS.
